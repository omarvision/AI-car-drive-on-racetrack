# AI-car-drive-on-racetrack
Im working on a racing game in Unity. This is probably my 5th attempt to complete a racing game. In this tutorial I plan to explain how I will have the AI cars drive around the race track. In simple form, the AI cars will follow checkpoints around the track. The checkpoints I place on the track in design time. Each checkpoint has an invisible wall that fires a trigger event when the car collides with it. Then I change the checkpoint the Ai car aims at.
